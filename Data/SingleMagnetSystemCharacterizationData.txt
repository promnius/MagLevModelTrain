Single magnet system characterization data

for use verifying against model

Experiment: apply full power to electromagnet with various thicknesses of plastic plate between electromagnet and target.
place target below electromagnet so it gets pulled up by the electromagnet.
slowly decrease power (and eventually go negative if needed) until target falls
record power level required to make magnet fall at a given height

target mass: 29 grams
screw head present (screw lowers effective base by 100 thou), distance (from base, so touching does NOT mean 0) in thousanths of an inch, 
power in pwm steps out of 1024 (so 512 means 50% duty cycle, 12V supply), estimated current in amps (based on power and a resistance of 3.7 ohms)
